# NLP Sentiment Analysis
 > Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed within an online mention.

Steps Performed to Acheive Sentiment Analysis: 

1. Extracted and cleaned Twitter Tweets according to an exhaustive list of
keywords and classes specific to patients’ medical experiences. In the filtering criteria the tweets containing any ads/promotions, government schemes or fund raisers, which were dropped.

2.  Classified cleaned tweets as Relevant or Irrelevant: Based on patient's experience with the overall process during a treatment, such as how did they feel while the treatment, were they scared, nervous, or pretty calm, was the hospital staff helpful, etc

3. Conducted sentiment analysis with Vader (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), which is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media for gaging patients’ experiences and gave a sentiment score of how positive, negative, or neutral a sentiment is.


Thus the tweets were classified into 3 sentiments namely:
  * Positive
  * Negative
  * Neutral
